# Deep Learning Implementations
This is a repository of implementations of deep learning papers, along with personal projects and experiments. Most are written
using a mix of TFLearn and Tensorflow. 

# Project Descriptions
Basic descriptions of the projects. They are all commented with the relevant information, so if you're curious about anything, check there. If it's not there, feel free to ask me!

	DeXpression- Implementation of the DeXpression paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05371
	
	Scout Net- A network architecture based off of DeXpression that utilizes highway convolutional layers.
	
	IMDB Highway- A network for sentiment analysis that uses 1-d convolutional highway layers.
